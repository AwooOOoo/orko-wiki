# Why is Orko free?

A lot of very good, practical reasons that mostly have nothing to do with ethics, although I am a big fan of the principles of [free (as-in-speech) software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html).

First, **it needs to be open source** so that you can audit it to make sure it's not going to steal your money. I simply wouldn't risk using some random piece of code from the internet (which _could do literally anything_) to manage my crypto investments, and nor should you. Being open source means you can rely on the wisdom of the developer community even if you are't a developer yourself. Being open source means it is next to impossible to stop someone just downloading the code and using it without paying a penny.

Next, **a team is needed**. An application such as Orko would be very hard to monetise without a massive commitment to support and maintenance. People use this software to manage large amounts of money, and what it's doing (talking to a large number of third party services) means it needs constant effort to keep working. Right now, just starting, it's just me. I need the help of more developers, or at least to be able to say _"if you want it, submit a pull request"_. Just from a purely economics standpoint, what's in it for them? This isn't a crypto exchange; Orko doesn't take fees, and no-one would use it if it did. There's never going to be much money; certainly not enough to pay engineering, dev-ops, support and operations staff.
