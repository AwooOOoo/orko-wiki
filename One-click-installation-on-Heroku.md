Okta is preconfigured and optimised to run securely on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The Hobby account is cheap at \$7/pm per server if running constantly. To instantly deploy your own instance of the application, just click the button below.  The Heroku installer will talk you through the process.

If that doesn't work, or you don't trust it, you can [install the application manually](https://github.com/badgerwithagun/orko/wiki/Manual-installation-on-Heroku).
