Okta is preconfigured and optimised to run securely on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The Hobby account is cheap at \$7/pm per server if running constantly.

# Installation

To instantly deploy your own instance of the application, just click the button below. The Heroku installer will talk you through the process.

To deploy the last stable release:

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/gruelbox/orko/tree/stable)

To deploy the latest development snapshot:

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/badgerwithagun/orko)

If that doesn't work, or you don't trust it, you can [install the application manually](Manual-installation-on-Heroku).
